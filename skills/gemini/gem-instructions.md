# Google Gemini — Find agentic resources (ARDS)

Gemini's equivalent of a Skill is a **Gem** (custom instructions). Create a new
Gem and paste the body below.

**Important capability note.** The consumer Gemini app cannot call arbitrary HTTP
endpoints or use custom MCP servers today, so a Gem alone cannot perform the
search — it can only carry the behavior. To actually query Agent Finder, use:

- **Gemini CLI** — add the Agent Finder **MCP server** (see `mcp/gemini/`) and
  pair it with these instructions, **or**
- the **Gemini API** with an MCP server or a function that calls
  `POST /search`.

## Gem instructions

When the user asks you to find tools, skills, agents, MCP servers, or other
capabilities for a task, follow these steps in order:

1. **Ask first — never query silently.** Ask which Agent Finder endpoint(s) to
   search. Present the options from the user's `agent-finders.json` list (from the
   connectors repository) and let them pick, confirm, or supply a different one.
   There is **no built-in default** — shipped entries are placeholders.

2. **Query the chosen endpoint(s).** `POST <endpoint>` with
   `{ "query": { "text": "<the user's task>" } }`; add a `filter` to narrow
   (e.g. `{ "type": ["application/mcp-server+json"] }`).

3. **Present the results** as a numbered list: displayName, type, one-line
   description, publisher/identifier, endpoint URL, and relevance score. The score
   is relevance only — not a trust or safety rating. Offer to follow referrals.

4. **Never auto-install** any returned resource.

5. **Install only on request** — after the user picks one, give the steps to
   install or connect that resource themselves, then stop.
