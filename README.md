# ARD connectors

Client-side connectors that let a chatbot **discover agentic resources** — tools,
skills, MCP servers, agents, and APIs — by searching [ARD](https://ards.io)
discovery services such as **Agent Finder**.

These connectors are **client-side only**. The discovery service (e.g. Agent
Finder) exposes the HTTP `POST /search` and the remote MCP interface; this repo
contains no server. Each connector just points your chatbot at an Agent Finder
endpoint you choose.

## The contract — what every connector does

Every connector follows the same flow (canonical text:
[`shared/discovery-instructions.md`](shared/discovery-instructions.md)). Nothing
is installed automatically:

1. **Ask first** — when you ask it to find tools/skills/agents for a task, it
   asks **which Agent Finder endpoint(s)** to query.
2. **Query** those endpoints (`POST /search`).
3. **Present** the ranked results for you to review (relevance score is *not* a
   trust or safety rating).
4. **Never auto-installs** anything.
5. **Installs only on request** — once you pick a result, it shows you how to add
   that resource yourself.

## Quick install — Claude Code

This repo is a Claude Code plugin marketplace. Install the skill with:

```
/plugin marketplace add ardp-project/connectors
/plugin install find-agentic-resources@ardp-connectors
```

Custom skills are currently Claude Code–only (not the claude.ai web app or
Desktop). For other platforms, see the per-platform folders below.

## Two ways to connect

- **Skill** — a portable instruction bundle that drives the flow over HTTP. Works
  on platforms with a "Skills"-style mechanism and an HTTP/Action capability.
- **MCP** — add an Agent Finder **remote MCP** connector so the chatbot gets a
  native search tool, paired with the Skill for the behavior.

## Per-platform connectors

| Platform | Skill | MCP |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Claude** | [`skills/find-agentic-resources/`](skills/find-agentic-resources/) | [`mcp/claude/`](mcp/claude/) |
| **ChatGPT** | [`skills/chatgpt/`](skills/chatgpt/) | [`mcp/chatgpt/`](mcp/chatgpt/) |
| **Microsoft Copilot** | [`skills/copilot/`](skills/copilot/) | [`mcp/copilot/`](mcp/copilot/) |
| **Gemini** | [`skills/gemini/`](skills/gemini/) | [`mcp/gemini/`](mcp/gemini/) |

> Capability notes: ChatGPT Skills and Developer-mode MCP are gated to certain
> plans; the consumer **Gemini app** has neither custom MCP nor HTTP, so use the
> Gemini **CLI** or **API** there. Each folder spells out the specifics.

## Endpoints

There is **no built-in default** Agent Finder. You choose which discovery
services to trust by editing [`agent-finders.json`](agent-finders.json) — a list
of endpoints the connector presents and asks you to pick from. The shipped
entries (`*.example.org`, `*.internal.example`) are placeholders; replace them
with real discovery services. The connector never queries an endpoint you didn't
choose, and never auto-installs what it finds.
